<ul>
<li> Append <code>/new</code> in the URL to create a new feed
<li> In case you wish to view your feed, please use the link you had bookmarked. There's no way to search for avaiable feeds. It is by design as there is no authentication for any feed and anyone having the link can modify the feed.
